 <h1>The Story Behind the Creation of Baltisaur</h1>
  <ul class="posts">
    <li><span>Baltisaur, originally named as Baltimore, is the destination of students and professionals from all over the world. <br/><br/>When moving to a new city, individuals ask themselves many questions related to housing, commuting, where to find necessities, where to hang out, among many others. The city of Baltimore offers a lot of reliable print and web sources that would answer these questions. However, the information is very decentralized. Movers have to read tens and tens of pages, link information, and then make a decision that, sometimes, is not a very informed one. <br/><br/>
 
Baltisaur provides users the opportunity to use an interactive map that simultaneously showcases housing, commuting options, grocery stores and main attractions, and consequently, allow them to make a well-informed decision.</li>
